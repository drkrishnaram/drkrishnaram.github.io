# Introduction to DuckDB in Python

DuckDB is an embedded SQL database management system designed for fast analytics workloads. It is optimized for OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) queries, similar to databases like Apache Parquet or SQLite but focuses specifically on analytical queries.

In this post, we'll explore how to use DuckDB from Python. You'll learn how to set it up, perform some basic operations, and explore advanced features to see how DuckDB can enhance your data analysis and processing tasks.

## What is DuckDB?

DuckDB is a lightweight, open-source database designed for executing complex queries on large datasets efficiently. Unlike traditional databases that require a separate server, DuckDB is embedded within your application, making it easy to install and use. It allows you to:

- Run SQL queries on large datasets
- Perform analytical queries quickly
- Use it as a lightweight alternative to larger systems (like PostgreSQL or BigQuery) for specific use cases

DuckDB is built with columnar storage, making it particularly well-suited for analytical workloads and large datasets, similar to data warehouses but without the overhead.

## Why Use DuckDB?

DuckDB offers several advantages, particularly when working with Python and data analysis tasks:

- **In-Memory Execution**: DuckDB executes queries in-memory, allowing it to process large datasets efficiently.
- **SQL Interface**: With DuckDB, you can work with SQL queries, making it ideal for those familiar with relational databases.
- **Columnar Storage**: Optimized for analytics, making it efficient for queries on large datasets.
- **Python Integration**: DuckDB seamlessly integrates with Python, making it an excellent tool for data scientists and analysts who need to run complex SQL queries on their data.
- **Fast Query Execution**: DuckDB is designed to handle analytical queries much faster than other lightweight database systems like SQLite.

Now that we have a general understanding of DuckDB, let’s dive into how to use it within Python.

## Installing DuckDB

Before we start using DuckDB in Python, you first need to install the `duckdb` package. You can install it easily via `pip`:

```bash
pip install duckdb
```

Once the installation is complete, we can import `duckdb` into our Python code to start interacting with the database.

## Setting Up DuckDB in Python

Once you’ve installed the DuckDB package, setting it up in Python is straightforward.

### Example 1: Connect to a DuckDB Database

To get started, let’s create a simple in-memory database using DuckDB. DuckDB can run entirely in memory, which means there’s no need for setting up a database server or configuring disk-based storage.

```python
import duckdb

# Connect to an in-memory DuckDB instance
con = duckdb.connect(database=':memory:')
```

In this example, we’re creating a connection to an in-memory database by passing the string `:memory:`. DuckDB will store everything in memory, and once the session ends, all data will be lost.

If you want to persist your data between sessions, you can specify a file path instead:

```python
con = duckdb.connect(database='my_database.duckdb')
```

Now you have a connection to a DuckDB instance where you can execute SQL queries and perform operations.

### Example 2: Creating Tables and Inserting Data

Now that you have an active connection, let’s create a simple table and insert some data. DuckDB supports standard SQL, so the syntax is quite familiar.

```python
# Create a sample table
con.execute("""
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INTEGER,
    name VARCHAR,
    age INTEGER
)
""")

# Insert some data
con.execute("""
INSERT INTO users VALUES 
(1, 'Alice', 30),
(2, 'Bob', 25),
(3, 'Charlie', 35)
""")
```

### Example 3: Querying Data

Now that we have some data, let’s run a simple query to retrieve the data from our `users` table.

```python
# Run a query and fetch results
results = con.execute("SELECT * FROM users").fetchall()

# Print results
for row in results:
    print(row)
```

This will print:

```
(1, 'Alice', 30)
(2, 'Bob', 25)
(3, 'Charlie', 35)
```

This demonstrates a basic interaction with the DuckDB database. The `fetchall()` method retrieves all the results from the query and returns them as a list of tuples.

## Working with DataFrames in DuckDB

One of the great features of DuckDB is its seamless integration with pandas DataFrames. You can easily load data from a pandas DataFrame into DuckDB and vice versa.

### Example 4: Querying Pandas DataFrames with DuckDB

If you already have a pandas DataFrame and want to run SQL queries on it, DuckDB allows you to execute SQL directly on pandas DataFrames.

First, let’s import pandas and create a simple DataFrame:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a pandas DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'id': [1, 2, 3],
    'name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
    'age': [30, 25, 35]
})
```

You can now execute SQL queries directly on this DataFrame using DuckDB:

```python
# Execute SQL on pandas DataFrame
query = "SELECT * FROM df WHERE age > 30"
result_df = con.execute(query).fetchdf()

# Print the resulting DataFrame
print(result_df)
```

Output:

```
   id     name  age
0   3  Charlie   35
```

In this example, we ran a SQL query on the pandas DataFrame `df` to select only the users who are older than 30. The `fetchdf()` method returns the result as a pandas DataFrame, making it easy to integrate with your existing data analysis pipeline.

### Example 5: Writing DataFrames to DuckDB

If you want to persist a pandas DataFrame into a DuckDB table, you can use the `duckdb.from_pandas()` method:

```python
# Write the DataFrame into a DuckDB table
con.execute("CREATE TABLE users_from_df AS SELECT * FROM df")
```

This will create a new table in DuckDB using the data from the `df` DataFrame. You can then query it just like any other DuckDB table.

## Advanced Features

### 1. Using Parquet Files with DuckDB

DuckDB has strong integration with Parquet files, a popular columnar storage format for big data. You can read and query Parquet files directly from DuckDB, making it easy to work with large datasets without having to load them into memory.

```python
# Read a Parquet file into DuckDB
con.execute("CREATE TABLE parquet_data AS SELECT * FROM read_parquet('your_file.parquet')")

# Query the table
result = con.execute("SELECT * FROM parquet_data").fetchall()
```

This allows you to run SQL queries on Parquet files directly, without having to load them into pandas first.

### 2. Performance Optimization

DuckDB is optimized for analytical queries, but you can take additional steps to further optimize performance. Here are some tips:

- **Indexes**: While DuckDB automatically handles indexing, in some cases, you may want to create additional indexes manually.
- **Query Plan**: You can inspect the query plan using `EXPLAIN` to understand how your queries are being executed.
- **Data Partitioning**: For very large datasets, partitioning your data into smaller chunks can help improve query performance.

### 3. Integration with Other Libraries

DuckDB integrates well with various other libraries in the Python ecosystem, including:

- **Dask**: You can use Dask with DuckDB for distributed analytics on large datasets.
- **PyArrow**: DuckDB can read and write Arrow tables, allowing for seamless interoperability with Arrow-based systems.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: DuckDB works perfectly within Jupyter Notebooks, allowing for interactive SQL querying and visualizations.

## Conclusion

DuckDB is a powerful and lightweight tool for running SQL queries within Python. With its seamless integration into the Python ecosystem, support for pandas DataFrames, and excellent performance on large analytical datasets, DuckDB is a great choice for data scientists and analysts.

In this post, we’ve covered the basics of setting up DuckDB, querying data, working with pandas DataFrames, and some advanced features like Parquet integration and performance optimization. DuckDB's simplicity and power make it a valuable addition to any data scientist's toolkit.
